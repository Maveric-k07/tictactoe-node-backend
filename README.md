# TicTacToe-Backend

This is a **NodeJs** project serving as backend for the tictactoe multiplayer game project. 

## Made with NodeJs, express, socketio and MongoDB
Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install the required dependencies in the `package.json` file.
Clone the project on your device and initialise npm using `npm init` in cmd.
Install the dependencies using the `npm i` command.
Use `npm start` to start the project.

## Working
1. Connect to your mongoDb cluster using your own credentials and replace it with the ones present in the `index.js` script.
2. In the `socket_client.dart` folder of the [flutter tictactoe project](https://github.com/Maveric-k07/tictactoe-flutter-frontend) change the address to your deployed url or use your local IP address during development.
3. Run the flutter app to connect to the socket server and enjoy developing! Check the [README.md]() of the flutter frontend project to get started.
